Attester - Junit
================

*attester-junit* is a Junit runner which allows Javascript tests to be run as if they were JUnit tests.
[attester](https://github.com/ariatemplates/attester) is used in the background to execute the tests and get the results.

This tool is useful to integrate attester with any Junit-compatible program (Eclipse, ...).
